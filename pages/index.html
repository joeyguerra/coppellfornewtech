        <h2>Why We‚Äôre Fighting for New Tech</h2>
        <p>We‚Äôre a group of Coppell parents, students, and citizens standing up to protect innovative public
            education. New Tech High was promised three years to grow - now it's being threatened with premature
            closure. While we understand the administration is under pressure to cut costs, we want to provide an
            alternative approach.</p>
        <p>In 2008, this district did something bold. It took a risk on a new kind of school - one that wasn't based
            on rows of desks and rote memorization, but on collaboration, critical thinking, and real-world problem
            solving.</p>
        <p>That school was New Tech High @ Coppell. It was created with a mission: to prepare students not just to
            pass tests, but to lead - to face complexity with creativity, to work in teams, and to develop the
            confidence to solve problems no one had solved before.</p>
        <p>Today, we are facing exactly the kind of problem New Tech was built to address.</p>
        <p>Yes, enrollment is down. Yes, the budget is tight. But before we talk about closing doors, we need to ask
            ourselves: Are we living up to the original promise of New Tech? Or are we abandoning it just when we
            need it most?</p>
        <p>Let‚Äôs not retreat from innovation. Let‚Äôs lead with it.</p>
        <p>Let‚Äôs show the rest of Texas what it looks like when a district doesn‚Äôt retreat from innovation - but
            doubles down on it.</p>
        <p>Let's show everyone what 21st-century education really looks like in action.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Project-Based and Problem-Based Learning (PBL)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The curriculum is built around real-world problems that require students to investigate, design,
                        and implement solutions, not just memorize facts.</li>
                    <li>Students take on authentic roles, such as researchers, designers, project managers, or
                        advocates, and their work often results in products or solutions that impact the community or
                        address genuine needs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Higher-Order Thinking and Transfer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students are regularly challenged with tasks that go beyond recall. They must analyze,
                        synthesize, and apply knowledge in new and unpredictable contexts.</li>
                    <li>Assessments and classroom activities are designed to prompt students to integrate concepts,
                        wrestle with ambiguity, and transfer learning to novel situations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Open-Ended Inquiry and Socratic Questioning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faculty use open-ended questions and Socratic dialogue, which encourage students to explore
                        multiple solutions, justify their reasoning, and reflect on their learning processes.</li>
                    <li>Example: Instead of asking for the ‚Äòright‚Äô answer, they ask students, ‚ÄòHow would you approach
                        this problem?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat do you know or What do you need to know?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat alternatives could we
                        consider?‚Äô</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Reflection and Metacognition</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note that students are encouraged to journal and reflect on their learning, helping them
                        internalize complex concepts and evaluate their thinking strategies. They are often asked to
                        reflect on an assignment to identify their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Collaboration and Diverse Perspectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Group projects and other collaborative activities are central, enabling students to debate,
                        negotiate, and build upon each other‚Äôs ideas, mirroring the complexity of real-world
                        problem-solving. They learn to engage in respectful dialogue when challenged. They often work in
                        a college seminar-style class.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Real-World Relevance and Community Connection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emphasize that projects are often connected to current events, community issues, or students‚Äô
                        own interests and identities, making learning meaningful and personally relevant. Sometimes,
                        projects are an individual effort, and different skill sets are developed, as with the required
                        Capstone projects, which demand in-depth inquiry. Students must formulate questions, conduct
                        research, evaluate sources, and synthesize findings to inform their work.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>At our school, students don‚Äôt just learn information‚Äîthey learn how to think. Through project-based learning, they tackle real-world challenges, collaborate in teams, and apply their knowledge to authentic problems that matter to them and their community.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Our teachers design assignments that require inquiry, design, evaluation, argumentation, and systems analysis‚Äîskills that prepare students for the unpredictable, complex world beyond graduation.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>We believe that every student is capable of complex thought. That‚Äôs why our curriculum is built to foster higher-order thinking, encourage open-ended questioning, and support students as they</blockquote>
