            <h2>#1: Transportation Fees for Elective Shuttles</h2>
            <p>
                Other districts charge for elective-related intercampus travel. If Coppell ISD charged $370/year per
                rider like Keller ISD, we could raise between $92,500 and $185,000 depending on participation. Fees for
                all bus users could generate over $2 million annually.

            <h2>#2: Boost ADA With Better Absence Documentation</h2>
            <p>
                Improve how we collect medical or parent notes so absences don't reduce state funding. A 1% improvement
                in attendance can bring in over $1 million in additional revenue.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>#3: Expand Open Enrollment</h2>
            <p>
                Frisco ISD projects $750,000 in revenue for every 100 open enrollment students. With targeted marketing
                and policy updates, New Tech could fill open seats and generate hundreds of thousands in revenue.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>#4: Increase Facility Rental Revenue</h2>
            <p>
                Other districts use platforms like Facilitron to market and rent out gyms and meeting spaces. CISD could
                expand after-hours rentals and double facility revenue with better outreach and fee alignment.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>#5: Increase and Enforce Technology Fees</h2>
            <p>
                Other DFW districts charge $50–$75/year and make tech fees mandatory. CISD charges $35 but doesn't
                enforce it. Making it mandatory - especially for secondary and choice schools - could raise over
                $500,000.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>#6: Resell or Repurpose Unused Tech Assets</h2>
            <p>
                Districts using centralized inventory and surplus resale systems recover 10%–40% of original tech value.
                Even partial implementation could generate $20,000–$100,000.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion & Ask</h2>
            <p>
                These ideas can generate millions in recurring revenue and avoid disruptive campus closures. We urge the
                CISD Board to explore and act on these options before making irreversible decisions.
