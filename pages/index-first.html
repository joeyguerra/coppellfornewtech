    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to share stories and speaking points with the CISD School Board at the meeting on <strong>Monday, May 19</strong> to respectfully urge them to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>NOT close New Tech or consolidate it into CHS</li>
      <li>Honor the originally promised 3-year window to increase enrollment and develop sustainable solutions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Talking Points from the Community</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We want to partner positively and constructively with the district — not fight. Let us help save this school.</li>
      <li>New Tech's small, inclusive environment is essential for neurodivergent students and those with anxiety to thrive.</li>
      <li>New Tech is a complete learning environment and culture — not just a curriculum that can be merged into a hallway.</li>
      <li>Enrollment struggles are worsened by repeated threats of closure. Consistent support is key to retention and growth.</li>
      <li>The proposed $350k shuttle savings is only 0.2% of the district budget — a minimal amount for what’s at stake.</li>
      <li>Many families are willing to pay for shuttle services to preserve the standalone campus.</li>
      <li>New Tech students are trained to solve real-world problems — why not engage them to help solve this one?</li>
      <li>Consolidation would erase New Tech's identity, culture, and impact — which helps students stand out in college applications and careers.</li>
      <li>Parents are considering moving out of the district or withdrawing their children if New Tech is closed or merged.</li>
      <li>We were promised 3 years to improve enrollment — it’s been only a few months. We must honor that agreement.</li>
      <li>New Tech supports students with chronic illnesses, low bullying rates, and accessible facilities.</li>
      <li>Many parents moved to Coppell specifically for New Tech — breaking trust impacts the community and property values.</li>
      <li>Capstone projects, Flex Fridays, and clubs like "Go With the Flow" offer rich experiences that aren’t possible in a traditional setting.</li>
    </ul>
