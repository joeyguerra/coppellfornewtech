CISD Financial
Landscape
Where are we now? 
Abstract Minimalist Lined Repeating Square Shape

Texas School Funding Basics

Revenues
- Local property taxes, state and federal funding

Property Taxes

Maintenance & Operations Taxes + Interest & Sinking Taxes = Toal Taxes

Maintenance & Operations Taxes
Used for salaries, curriculum, campus, expenses, operating expenses such as transportation, maintenance, safety & security, etc.

Interest & Sinking Taxes
Used for the principal and interest payments on the district’s debt (bonds issued). Cannot be used for salaries, campus or operating expenses. 

How is a district's funding entitlement calculated?

Funding Entitlement

- The state calculates each district’s entitlement based upon the number of students in the district, the students’ attendance rate, and the composition of needs of those students.
- Basic allotment per student in average daily attendance (ADA)
- Emergent bilingual, special education, dyslexia, economically disadvantaged, career & technology, gifted, school safety

How much revenue does the State of Texas allow districts to keep? 
Taxes Collected & state funding - Funding Entitlement = Amount recaptured by State of Texas

The taxes collected in excess of the calculated funding entitlement is sent to the state.

How can a district increase its funding entitlement without increasing taxes?

Funding Entitlement
- Increase enrollment.
- Increase attendance.
- Increase % of students with specific needs (also increases expenses).

How can the state increase school funding without increasing taxes?
- Increase the basic allotment
- Increase the weighted funding for students with specific needs
- Increase allotments for transportation or safety

How did Coppell ISD’s operating fund perform for the 2023-24 fiscal year?

Revenues | $ 155,520,211
Expenditures | $ 162,514,050
Recapture (included above) | $ 22,360,852
Deficit | $ (6,993,839)
One time source of revenue | $ 456,088
Reduction of Fund Balance | $ (6,537,751)



What is Coppell ISD doing to increase revenue and decrease expenses?

- Marketing to increase enrollment
- Open enrollment
- Attendance Matters campaign
- Corporate sponsorships and advertising
- Increasing offerings of Career & Technology courses
- Increase fees, rental fees, transportation fees, ticket prices, etc
- Partnership with City of Coppell for Student Resource Officers (SROs)
- Utilization of available grant funds (SAFE, Metrocrest, Title)
- Reducing staff payroll through attrition
- Reducing overall budgets for departments and campuses
- Finding efficiencies within operations to reduce costs
- Reducing payroll by staffing at appropriate student:teacher ratios
- Consolidation of programs
- Reduction of shuttles
- Reduction of custodial additional services
- Reduction of above-district budget
- Consolidation of one elementary campus as enrollment declines

What else is Coppell ISD considering to increase revenue and decrease expenses?
FYI: School districts spend around 80% of their budget on staff (payroll)

BUDGET REDUCTIONS COULD INCLUDE:
- Hiring freeze
- No or lower raise for staff
- Increased class sizes
- Increased additional fees 
- Program cuts or reductions
- Other school consolidations
- Reduction of staff
- Changes to secondary scheduling
- Changes to transportation 
- Evaluate open enrollment expansion 

THE VATRE WOULD HAVE ADDED $2.4 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS
Since the VATRE did not pass, we will have to make more cuts now. 
NO VATRE = MORE CUTS

Coppell ISD 2030 Strategic Planning

Fiscal and Operational Systems:
Objective 7 - Determine a long-term properties plan taking into account age of facilities, available space, current and projected enrollment and program needs.

7.1 Strategy - Implement an evaluation process and a prioritization matrix to assess current and future expenditures.

7.1.1 Specific Result - Develop an evaluation process that promotes more efficient facility and property management, cost savings, improved learning environments, transparency, data-driven decision-making, and long-term sustainability in property management by prioritizing expenditures and addressing long-term needs.

Budget Survey
What programs or services do you believe are the most important to your family?
Which programs or services have the most impact on your child’s education and
overall school experience?

Programs/Services Mentioned Frequently:
GT, IB, AP, Honors, Dual Credit
504, Dyslexia Services, Special Education
Fine Arts (Band, Choir, Art, Theater)
STEAM, Robotics, PBL
DLI, Spanish, ASL
Athletics, Student Leadership, CTE
Counseling, Mental Health Services
Library Services, Small Class Sizes, Transportation

Overall, the responses reflect a strong desire to maintain academic excellence,
provide student support services, and continue offering diverse extracurricular
opportunities to ensure a well-rounded education.

Budget Survey
Do you feel budget constraints have affected your child's classroom experience?
Please provide specific examples.

General Themes: 
Increased Class Sizes
Changes in Specialized Programs like GT, DLI
School Consolidation
Teacher Retention
Resources and Support Services
Fewer Elective, Extracurricular & Advanced Course Options
No Impact Yet, But Concerned for the Future

Some families have not seen major changes yet, but many anticipate worsening
conditions next year. Larger class sizes, fewer resources, and teacher burnout are key
challenges cited.

Budget Survey
Innovative Revenue Strategies
Suggestions included fundraisers, recruiting more students, corporate
sponsorships, and tax adjustments.
Several responses called for maximizing existing resources rather than seeking
new revenue streams.

Areas for Spending Reduction
Some suggested closing New Tech High School and limiting administrative roles.
Other ideas included reducing non-essential expenses and reassessing large
spending projects.
Reducing unnecessary bus routes. 

Willingness for Increased Fees
Responses were mixed, with some agreeing to pay higher fees for specific
programs.
Others emphasized that fees should remain optional to avoid placing financial
strain on families.

Budget Survey
Community Partnership for Budget Relief
Some suggested local business sponsorships and fundraising efforts.
Others were unsure of how the community could help beyond existing tax
contributions.

Donations to CISD Education Foundation
Responses were split between those who have donated and those who have not.
Reasons for donating included supporting specific grants or initiatives.
Non-donors often cited lack of awareness or belief that public funding should
cover education.

Critical Programs to Preserve
Teacher quality, special education, and GT programs were frequently mentioned.
Some emphasized smaller class sizes and personalized learning as priorities.

Coppell ISD has sent $776 million in recapture payments to
the state since the beginning of the program in 1993.  It is
estimated that the district will send about $32 million in 2025.

What is recapture?

In a 1993 response to court rulings calling for a more equitable school funding
system, the Legislature began requiring school districts with higher levels of
property wealth per student to pay recapture. Recapture is the process through
which these districts send some of their local property-tax revenue to the state.
The process is often referred to as Robin Hood. The intent of recapture is to
help all school districts have roughly similar amounts of money to spend per
child. But over time, recapture has grown considerably, and today recapture
payments have grown so large that the state uses those dollars to support a
considerable amount of the state’s funding obligation for education, therefore
freeing up state funds to help balance the rest of the state budget.

What causes recapture
payments to increase?
The system of funding public education relies heavily on local property taxes.
And the more the system relies on property taxes, the more it relies on
recapture. When property values increase, which they have in recent years,
then more of a district’s local revenue becomes subject to recapture unless
the district is growing by a proportional amount of students, or if the state
chooses to increase its investment in public education or to invest more in
property tax rate reduction.

Can school districts reduce
recapture by reducing the
tax rate?


It’s not that simple. If a district reduces its tax rate beyond reductions that are
mandated in state law, the state reduces the district’s entitlement, which is the
amount of money that the state says a district should have to educate each
student. Therefore, a district that reduced its tax rate in order to pay less in
recapture would likely pay about the same amount to the state in recapture, but
it would have fewer dollars to educate students and pay teachers.

Pinkerton Facility/Land
Financial Considerations
Potential o n e - t i m e r e v e n u e from s a l e of land:
• Broker's opinion of value ranges between $3.8 million - $8.4 million depending upon zoning changes and use.
• 2.2% - 4.8% of total district expenditure budget
• Annual property value appreciation based on 5-year historical average and opinion of value
• $367,000 - 810,000 annually
• $1.1 million - $2.4 million by 2028
Annual revenue from lease of land, building and property spaces:
• Ground lease revenue potential - unknown
• Annual building space rentals/lease potential ~ $300,000 plus annually
• Expenditure savings, bond dollars, for elementary renovations - $2.5 million per renovation
• 8% of estimated renovation contract

Pinkerton Facility/Land
D i s t r i c t R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s
Based on input and feedback from the Coppell ISD Efficiency Review Committee (CERC) at the
February 18, 2025 meeting and the CISD Cabinet at the March 27, 2025 meeting, the following
recommendation is presented to address the use of the Pinkerton facility and land.
2025-26 School year:
• Move staff housed in Brock Training Rooms into available classrooms in Pinkerton building.
• Create additional meeting spaces in Pinkerton building (Library, largest classrooms, etc)
• Allow facility rentals of Gym and Cafeteria during the day and evening
• Lease East Wing to YMCA for employee day care (CISD employees and YMCA employees to start)
2026-27 School year:
• Consider the use of the building to house students attending elementary school under major
renovation. Could add portables if need additional capacity.
• Continue use from 25-26 recommendations if space is available
2027-28 and beyond:
• Consider use of building/land in long-range facility planning
• Consider potential bond dollars needed for long-term facility plan


2025-26 School year:
• Move staff housed in Brock Training Rooms into available classrooms in Pinkerton building.
• Create additional meeting spaces in Pinkerton building (Library, largest classrooms, etc)
• Allow facility rentals of Gym and Cafeteria during the day and evening
• Lease East Wing to YMCA for employee day care (CISD employees and YMCA employees to start)
PROS:
• Provides staff to monitor/manage building (not abandoned)
• Frees up Training Space in Brock for its intended use
• Creates additional professional learning spaces for district use (centralized training hub)
• Generates revenue (facility rentals)
• Adds employee daycare for staff
• Addresses concern about selling land and future use
• Retains l a n d for c o n t i n u e d district u s e
• Relieves CMS West large group instruction space from continual district use
CONS:
• Requires furniture & technology for training rooms (repurpose furniture & technology from current
or o t h e r l o c a t i o n s
• If daycare started, could limit use of Pinkerton building for other purposes in future.
• Continued expense for custodial/maintenance and utilities

2026-27 School year:
• Consider the use of the building to house students attending elementary school under major
renovation. Could add portables if need additional capacity.
• Continue use from 25-26 recommendations if space is available
PROS:
• Continued revenue from facility rentals and daycare
• Continued utilization of space by district for professional development/meetings
Continued staff benefit of employee daycare
C O N S :
• Using building to house students from elementary school under renovation could be limiting
• Daycare remains in space
• Sharing of playground equipment and facilities
Rental of facilities during day would cease
• May need to add portables to have enough capacity for entire school population
2027-28 and beyond:
• Consider use of building/land in long-range facility planning
• Consider potential bond dollars needed for long-term facility plan



High level o b s e r v a t i o n s of t h e d a t a from t h e
R u b r i c S u b c o m m i t t e e
• Elementary schools a s a whole are inefficient
• Larger elementaries (Canyon Ranch, Lee) are more efficient
• The purpose of the Decision Filter is to evaluate facilities for the long-term,
not just based on the current use and utilization since the district can shift
enrollment between buildings through program placement or enrollment

COLLECTING FEEDBACK


WORK HAPPENING. ..
• Met with all secondary principals - 3 hour separate meetings (middle
and then high) went through all areas of their staffing and looked for
any possible adjustments that could b e m a d e (content, electives,
shuttles, etc.)
• Then met with all secondary principals a n d counselors supporting
m a s t e r schedule t o review additional u p d a t e s a n d n e e d s
• Also, reviewed transportation/shuttles (this year/next year and
making adjustments b a s e d on trying to create less shuttle cost) -
fine arts, athletics, courses offered at campuses, co-seating, CDLs
for staff, etc.
• Course guide requests have been made by learners, so reviewing at
the c a m p u s level a n d working with district personnel to review final
classes/staffing needs (reviewing class sizes, program needs, etc.)
• Middle schools aligning schedules a n d working on the alignment of
core instruction subjects taught a s best possible, for collaborative
opportunities for the following year.


WORK HAPPENING ..

All middle schools - only c o r e c o n t e n t additional
PLC/collaborative t e a m time (continuing
intervention/enrichment time for learners in schedule)
• High schools - PLC/collaborative team time may vary
based on core/electives, as more high school credits are
impacting levels of need
• No changes to schedules for 2025-2026 school year -
middle school still core PLC time a n d high schools still

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE:
POINTS TO CONSIDER - IMPACT
1 - Schedule change - moving from Block to Periods
(high school, Springen share)
2 - Moving to conference period only
(no PIC/Collaborative Team Time blocked out - extra planning -
Axelson shane)
3 - Limiting Shuttles
(lange focus on athletics, fine arts, course offerings, time of day)
4 - Class Size for Sections Requined


BUDGETING AND COST:
What is each secondary campus current cost to run their current
schedule?(staffing cost)

S c h o o l Year # students
Payroll cost
Coppell High School $19,766,774 2,981 $6,631|

1044 Coppel Middle School North $6,544,754 988 $6,6241


BUDGETING AND COST:
Cost of shuttles - daily
( r o u t e s a n d t o t a l s )
Shuttle Cost is $99.66 per shuttle
each day. We have 33 shuttles a day.
Daily cost is $3,288.78.
For 171 days, the cost is $562,381.38.


BUDGETING AND COST:
Use $75,000 as the cost of a teacher's
salary/benefits.
A HS teacher may not work more than 7 out of 8
p e r i o d s
(conference period).
$75,000/7 = $10,714 per period
For every period that a HS teacher h a s off it costs
$10,714.
Multiply $10,714 x # periods off on each campus to
obtain c a m p u s cost.
Middle school is $12,500 per period off.


BUDGETING AND COST:
C o s t o f s u b s f o r P L C t i m e -
c a r v e d o u t for o n c e a m o n t h
Use $115 for the cost of a substitute for one day.
Assuming that PLC would b e for a n entire day
o n c e p e r m o n t h :
The c o s t of a s u b for HS PLC = 301 t e a c h e r s x 10
months x $115 = $346,150 or 10.7% of current
PLC structure.
The c u r r e n t c o s t of HS PLC =
301 periods off x $10,714 = $3,224,914

NEXT STEPS AND OTHER
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS DISCUSSED:
• Before a n y big c h a n g e with Block schedule - survey learners,
families and all secondary high school staff on their thoughts
• Rethink shuttles - with any change from Block to 7 Periods
• Before any big change with PLC time - survey for feedback all
secondary staff
• Look at possibility of school within a school - New Tech
• Look at possibility of open enrollment for growth in enrollment
n u m b e r s - New Te c h
• Look at district n e e d s - enrollment dropping at elementary


April 23, 2025 Meeting Presentation


Bold Colorful Memphis Red Circle With Circled Stripes
What else is Coppell ISD considering to
increase revenue and decrease
expenses?
BUDGET REDUCTIONS COULD INCLUDE:
Hiring freeze
No or lower raise for staff
Increased class sizes
Increased additional fees 
Program cuts or reductions
Other school consolidations
Reduction of staff
Changes to secondary scheduling
Changes to transportation 
Evaluate open enrollment
expansion 

To address the current and projected deficits,
Coppell ISD has a targeted goal of at least
 $2 million* in permanent, sustainable, reduced
expenditures or increased revenues annually.
2025-26
*this does not allow for a cost-of-living increase for teachers & staff.  To provide a 3%
cost-of-living increase, the district would target $5 million annually 
(based on current law as of 1/1/25)


Ways to Address CISD’s Budget Challenges

Acceptance Threshold
You will rate your threshold for the
acceptance for options to address
CISD’s budget challenges.

Then as a group, we will reflect and
summarize the pros and cons of the
option. 

Options presenting tonight
Close one elementary school
Close two elementary schools
Options for New Tech High @ Coppell
Staff cost-of-living increase prioritization
Elementary student program
Secondary student program
District staff support program
Reduction of free transportation
Class sizes 
Shuttles between high schools
Open Enrollment expansion

Close 1 Elementary School for the 26-27 school year
Estimated savings (does not include special education, support positions, extra-curriculars, or
transportation,  and assumes no reduction in classroom teachers)
Payroll savings: $1.1 million assuming
teachers move with students
Building savings if divested:
$0.4 million

Close 2 Elementary Schools for the 26-27 school year
Estimated savings (does not include special education, support positions, extra-curriculars, or
transportation,  and assumes no reduction in classroom teachers)

Payroll savings: $2.2 million assuming
teachers move with students
Building savings if divested:
$0.8 million

Options for New Tech High @ Coppell

1 Leave NTH@C as is
2 Move NTH@C into CHS
3 Close NTH@C

Estimated savings (does not include special education, support positions, extra-curriculars)

Payroll savings: varies by option
Building savings if divested: $0.25 million
Transportation savings for options 2 and 3 ~ $0.25m
Payroll savings for option 2 ~ $1.4m
Payroll savings for option 3 ~ $1.8m


CISD Staff Raise Prioritization
1% ~ $1.05 million
2% ~ $2.10 million
3% ~ $3.15 million 

Elementary Student Facing Program
Payroll savings ~ $0.8 million per program

Secondary Student Facing Program
Payroll savings ~ $0.3 million per program

District Staff Support Program
- Leave all staff supports in place: Payroll savings ~ $2.3 million
- Cut a staff support program: Payroll savings ~ $3.8 million

Pay to Ride - except required transportation
Approximately 6,575 regular route riders
$500/annual bus pass ~ $3,000,000  (90% of current riders)
State reimbursement lost ~ $500,000
Net Revenue increase ~ $2,500,000
There would be a maximum charge per family. 
There would be exceptions for economically disadvantaged students.

Class Sizes at all Levels
Elementary: class size is currently targeted at 22:1 (PK-4) which is the
state requirement without a class-size waiver.
Secondary:  Increasing class sizes by 3 students, on average  ~ $2.1m

Shuttles to CHS, CHS9 and NTH@C
NT to CHS and CHS9:  13 shuttles cost approx. $220,000 per year

CHS to CHS9: 9 shuttles cost approximately $150,000 per year

Swim shuttles are being addressed separately. 

There is currently 1 Victory Place shuttle costing approximately $17,000
per year that is being addressed separately.


Open Enrollment
The current open enrollment program is designed to fill empty space in
a class that already has a teacher.  No additional staff is hired.
The program adds revenue of $1.5 - $1.8 million.

Expanding open enrollment to all students would require hiring additional staff. District has seen a student yield of ~4% from open enrollment neighborhoods and ~43% are elementary students. (For every 100 homes, 4 students enroll)

To generate an additional $1.5 - $1.8 million, would need to add at least 6000 homes @ 4% yield.
Likely that the yield drops as neighborhoods get further from district borders.
