        <h2>Why We‚Äôre Fighting for New Tech</h2>
        <p>We‚Äôre a group of Coppell parents, students, and citizens standing up to protect innovative public
            education. New Tech High was promised three years to grow - now it's being threatened with premature
            closure. While we understand the administration is under pressure to cut costs, we want to provide an
            alternative approach.</p>
        <p>In 2008, this district did something bold. It took a risk on a new kind of school - one that wasn't based
            on rows of desks and rote memorization, but on collaboration, critical thinking, and real-world problem
            solving.</p>
        <p>That school was New Tech High @ Coppell. It was created with a mission: to prepare students not just to
            pass tests, but to lead - to face complexity with creativity, to work in teams, and to develop the
            confidence to solve problems no one had solved before.</p>
        <p>Today, we are facing exactly the kind of problem New Tech was built to address.</p>
        <p>Yes, enrollment is down. Yes, the budget is tight. But before we talk about closing doors, we need to ask
            ourselves: Are we living up to the original promise of New Tech? Or are we abandoning it just when we
            need it most?</p>
        <p>Let‚Äôs not retreat from innovation. Let‚Äôs lead with it.</p>
        <p>Let‚Äôs show the rest of Texas what it looks like when a district doesn‚Äôt retreat from innovation - but
            doubles down on it.</p>
        <p>Let's show everyone what 21st-century education really looks like in action.</p>
