## FAQs

### Project Based Learning

1. **Does project based learning (PBL) mean there are no assessments at New Tech?**

    No. PBL model includes quizzes, tests and final exams. In the PBL model, the final project submission will be a major portion of student grade and these projects are the culmination of each learning unit. In these projects, students will have to apply the knowledge they have learned to real world issues. These culminating projects are graded by community members as well as facilitators.

1. **Does PBL result in some students doing all the work while others slack off?**

    No. While this could happen for short periods of time, there are regular benchmarks and feedback mechanisms where peers grade each other and it becomes clear when someone is not doing their work and the facilitator will step in when needed to help the team reach an achievable and acceptable compromise (including removing the student who is slacking off from the group).

1. **How can subjects like Math be taught using PBL?**

    These are a few examples of projects done in Geometry and Algebra I courses:
    - Geometry: constructed a roller coaster
    - Algebra: shark tank type business proposal

### Grading/Scores

1. **How does grading work at New Tech?**

    All students at New Tech are graded on 5 pillars - agency, collaboration, knowledge and thinking, oral communication and written communication. Agency (A) grade is based on whether the students asked questions, were proactive and whether the work was completed in a timely manner. Collaboration <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> grade is based on the grade peers give a student based on how well that student worked in the group. Knowledge and Thinking (K&T) grade is based on whether the student knows and understands the content being taught and can they apply it in different scenarios. Oral communication (OC) grade is given when students present their work and it is based on how well they are able to communicate what the project was about and what they learned. Written communication (WC) grades are based on whether a student can fulfill the rubric requirements for a written task and whether the writing is grammatically correct. The percentage each of these pillars contribute to a student’s final grade in a class is subject dependent. In math classes, K&T is worth 50%, but in English class K&T is worth 30% and WC is also worth 30%.
