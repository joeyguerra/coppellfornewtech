            <h2>#1: Optimize Contracted & Professional Services</h2>
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>CISD’s "Contracted Instructional Services" is a major budget line. Auditing, rebidding, and renegotiating these contracts, as well as exploring interlocal agreements or in-house options, can yield significant savings.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Plano ISD: Achieved 5–10% cost reductions after rebidding major service contracts.</li>
                <li>Richardson ISD: Saved $500,000 in one year using interlocal agreements for special services.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trustee Questions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When was the last comprehensive audit of all contracted services?</li>
                <li>Are any contracts up for renewal that could be rebid or renegotiated?</li>
                <li>Have we benchmarked our rates against other DFW districts?</li>
                <li>Could bringing some services in-house be more cost-effective?</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD: Consolidated admin roles and adopted automation, resulting in significant savings and improved efficiency.</li>
                <li>Statewide: Legislative Budget Board reviews show that districts reduce costs by reviewing staffing patterns and eliminating redundancies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trustee Questions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Where are there overlaps or inefficiencies in admin roles?</li>

            <h2>#3: Centralized Procurement & Bulk Purchasing</h2>
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Centralizing procurement and negotiating volume discounts lowers costs for supplies, equipment, and services.</p>
            <h3>DFW Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Frisco ISD: Centralized procurement for custodial and maintenance supplies, achieving 8–12% savings.</li>
                <li>Statewide, many districts leverage cooperative purchasing to achieve better pricing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trustee Questions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Are all departments using centralized procurement? If not, why not?</li>
                <li>What savings have we achieved through bulk purchasing?</li>
                <li>Are we leveraging regional or state purchasing cooperatives?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>#4: Enhance Facilities Efficiency & Preventive Maintenance</h2>
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Energy audits, efficiency upgrades (such as LED and HVAC), motion sensor lights and air conditioning, preventative maintenance, and smart facility management systems can yield significant, recurring savings.</p>
            <h3>DFW Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lewisville ISD: Saved $1.9M in utility costs in 2022 alone and over $29M since 2008 via energy efficiency and micro-scheduling.</li>
                <li>CFBISD: Water conservation partnership with Microsoft/HydroPoint to reduce utility and maintenance costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trustee Questions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When was our last energy/facility audit?</li>
                <li>What is our preventative vs. emergency maintenance ratio?</li>
                <li>What energy efficiency upgrades are planned or completed?</li>
                <li>Are we using smart systems for facility management?</li>
